# Azure services used in this project

I integreted QnAMAker with Web App bot. Then for hosting I have used Static Web App Service. Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps to Azure from a code repository.

# Azure Static Web Apps: 

Following are some key features of Azure Static Web Apps that made me choose this service:

1.Web hosting for static content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.

2.Integrated API support provided by Azure Functions with the option to link an existing Azure Functions app using a standard account.
